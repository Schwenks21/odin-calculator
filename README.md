Odin Project Fundamentals Final Project - Calculator

This is the final project of the TOP fundamentals section.  The project is to create a fully functioning basic calculator.  This project will require using a wide variety of functions and array methods in order to have the calculator function properly.  I'll update with README with issues that I faced and how I overcame them as I work through the project.
